# Speed_Typing_Test
This is a simple Python project that tests a user's typing speed. The application is built using the tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface. The user can type in a text box, and the application calculates their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of words typed and the time taken to type them.

Features:

- Reset button: Clicking this button resets the typing speed test and clears the text box.
- Typing box: The user types in this box.
- Timer: The timer records the duration of the typing session.
- WPM calculation: The application calculates the user's typing speed in WPM based on the number of words typed and the time taken to type them.
