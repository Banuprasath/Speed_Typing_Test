# Speed_Typing_Test
This is a simple Python project that tests a user's typing speed. The application is built using the tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface. The user can type in a text box, and the application calculates their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of words typed and the time taken to type them.
